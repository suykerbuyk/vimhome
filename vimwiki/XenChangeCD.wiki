Heads up for anyone who's stuck with trying to change a CD half-way 
through an HVM installation; I couldn't find an answer to this on Google. 

1 - just changing the file which contains the ISO image does nothing 

2 - in principle, you can get into the Qemu monitor from your 
installation Window, and change the disk from the monitor. You should 
apparently type CTL-ALT-2 to enter the monitor, or CTL CTL CTL-ALT-2. 
This doesn't work for me - he the number at 
the beginning of this entry (in my case, 5632). 

 > /usr/sbin/xm block-detach xm-domain-name 5632 
 > /usr/sbin/xm block-attach xm-domain-name file://path/to/my/ISO /dev/h see that nothing's changed. 

4 - the virsh way (does work): 

 > virsh list 

get the Id number of your domain from the first column 

 > virsh detach-disk Id-number hdc 
 > virsh attach-disk Id-number /path/to/your/new/ISO hdc --driver file 
--type cdrom --mode readonly 




disk = [ "file:/var/xen/images/yum.img,hda,w", "file:/var/xen/images/yum-cd-10.06.09.iso,hdc:cdrom,r" ]

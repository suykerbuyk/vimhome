Prep the USB sick:
	diskpart.exe
	list disk (Find USB device)
	select disk 1 (careful! select USB drive)
	clean
	create partition primary
	select partition 1
	active
	format quick fs=fat32 (UEFI can only USB boot to FAT32, not NTFS)
	assign (In this example, USB mount point become F: when assigned.)
	exit

Then copy the contents of the .ISO file (file system contents) to the USB stick.

Build Vars:
 - $SRC - Source Tree, always pulled from a stream
 - $OUT - Output Tree, where final build products go.
   * world, kernel, packages, image.archive.
   * shared between all build stages.
 - $OBJ - Intermediate or temp tree.
   * Where tool chains are build (poudriere, etc).
   * Where MAKEOBJPREFIXDIR points.
   * In ports, this is the WRKDIRPREFIX
 - Example:
   ($OUT,$OBJ)/pkg/
   ($OUT,$OBJ)/pkg/poudriere_etc/_CONF_FILES_
   ($OUT,$OBJ)/pkg/obj/build/products
   ($OUT,$OBJ)/pkg/obj/build/destdir (output products)
